# CabinetFlow Project Plan

## Executive Summary

CabinetFlow is a specialized document management system with QR code integration for custom cabinet makers. It's designed as a complementary solution to existing design software (like Cabinet Vision), focusing on streamlining file management, shop floor access to manufacturing data, and production tracking.

The system bridges the gap between design software and shop floor execution, providing an intuitive interface for accessing critical manufacturing information at the point of production. Rather than competing with design software, CabinetFlow enhances the production workflow by making design outputs accessible throughout the manufacturing process.
