# CabinetFlow

A document management system with QR code integration for custom cabinet makers.

## Overview

CabinetFlow is designed as a complementary solution to existing cabinet design software, focusing on streamlining file management, shop floor access to manufacturing data, and production tracking. Rather than competing with visualization tools, CabinetFlow serves as the critical bridge between design software and shop floor execution.

## Key Features

- Document management with version control for manufacturing files
- QR code generation and scanning for shop floor access to documents
- Import interfaces for popular cabinet design software
- Workstation-specific views (CNC, cutting, assembly)
- Production status tracking
